 * Create a observer interface - having one method update
 * Create one more interface called observerHandler for handling observer(s). 
 * 	This should have methods to add/remove/notify the observers. 
 * 	SInce we are going to handle multiple observers, this should have a List<observer>
 * Create an implementation for the observerHandler called MyObserverHandler implementing  all the methods
 * Create an implementation for Observer too now. It should have a reference for observerHandler
